export const paragraphOne = `I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer specializing in building scalable web applications with React, TypeScript, and Node.js. Most recently, I led frontend architecture at airx health, where I built a comprehensive UI component library and engineered patient-facing features for a pharmaceutical management platform.  I have deep experience with modern frontend tooling—Next.js, Redux Toolkit Query, Material UI—and backend technologies including Python/Django, GraphQL, as well as event-driven architectures. I'm passionate about developer experience and code quality, whether that's migrating to better tooling or integrating AI-assisted development workflows.`

export const paragraphTwo = `I excel at taking ownership of complex features from conception to deployment. At airx health, I was trusted with product direction and customer satisfaction on a small engineering team, building everything from scheduling portals to printer integrations. Previously at United Airlines, I modernized frontend architecture and built real-time notification systems serving thousands of users. I also contribute to open source—recently extending a Homebridge plugin to add smart home controls for GE appliances. I bring strong technical judgment, a collaborative mindset, and a drive to ship polished, user-focused products.`
